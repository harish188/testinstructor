"Coverage & Sequence

Score: 1.00/4.00

The session lacked clear alignment with the lesson plan. The instructor spent significant time on unrelated activities (e.g., quiz setup and feedback collection) and did not cover core topics in a structured sequence. Key topics like 'prompting techniques' and 'creativity' were mentioned but not elaborated upon.
Instructional Focus

Score: 1.00/4.00

The session contained significant off-topic content, including repeated administrative instructions (e.g., quiz setup at timestamps 00:00:00–00:02:05) and unrelated discussions about Goa trips and movie recommendations. These segments consumed a substantial portion of the session.
Score: 1.50/4.00

Explanation Clarity & Structure

Score: 2.00/4.00

The session lacked clear and structured explanations. The instructor did not consistently break down concepts step-by-step or use signposts like 'First...', 'Next...', 'Finally...'. There were repetitive and unclear instructions (e.g., 'Try to be quick' repeated multiple times without elaboration). Code demos or problem walkthroughs were absent, and the session lacked recaps or roadmaps.",Tech QA report issue
"Instructional Focus

Score: 2.00/4.00

The session included significant off-topic segments, such as extended discussions about feedback collection (e.g., 00:25:00–00:27:00) and unrelated tangents about best practices (e.g., 00:35:00–00:36:00). These detracted from the instructional focus.
Explanation Clarity & Structure

Score: 2.00/4.00

The explanations were often repetitive and lacked a clear, structured flow. Key concepts like 'container' and 'ruleset' were introduced but not always broken down step-by-step. The instructor frequently repeated phrases like 'so let's start' (e.g., 00:00:35–00:00:50) and did not consistently use signposts to guide the learners through the session. Code demos were present but were not always well-integrated with the slides, and there were missed opportunities for recaps.
Score: 2.00/4.00

The session had noticeable pacing issues, with the instructor spending excessive time on basic concepts (e.g., repeating the syntax for 'div' multiple times between 00:00:50–00:02:00). Some sections, like the explanation of inline styling (00:17:00–00:18:30), felt rushed compared to others. The session exceeded the expected duration, and the flow was disrupted by frequent digressions.

For the second session(3:40 to 4:40), the theory was not completed by the instructor due to the wifi issue. but since i was able to share the screen so i started with the coding practice on the same topic but students were not able to do the practice due to wifi issue. but when i'm trying to upload the recording, it's getting failed again and again and transcript is also very erroneous.

"I would like to bring to your attention an issue I faced regarding the assigned topics for today's class.
I was assigned two topics:
Introduction to HTML5 – This topic consists of 63 slides and 3 classroom quizzes. Each quiz has 6 questions. There are around 117 students in one class, and each quiz takes approximately 6 minutes to complete because all students needs to join to quiz through code displayed and answer for each quiz . Additionally, attendance was also taken during the class, which further consumed time. Due to this, I was only able to cover this topic and could not complete the second topic.
HTML Semantic Elements – This topic consists of 70 slides and 2 classroom quizzes.
Together, both topics amount to around 133 slides and 5 quizzes, which is difficult to cover within the available 60 minutes, especially considering that attendance needs to be taken in both the morning and afternoon sessions.
I wanted to inform you that it is difficult  to complete both topics within the 60 minutes.
 
Thank you for your understanding.

1) Student asked the question, So I went to another question , How come I didnt wait!
2) Red Flags is Zero, but still the ratio is 3.8/ 4.0 how come it is!!!!
3) In the slides itself it as the copy and paste the content, and get the prompt. Then What can I say for this!!!
4) I will strictly align my teaching flow with the PPT slides and lesson plan to maintain consistency.I will reintroduce the skipped examples (Swiggy, Amazon, BookMyShow) in the next session to ensure learners gain complete coverage.I will also refine my terminology usage (e.g., correctly referring to “Gamma”) and improve the clarity of explanations such as “agent mode” in GPT.I sincerely appreciate the feedback, as it helps me align better with expectations and improve the learner experience.
5) Thank you for the detailed feedback. I would like to provide some clarification regarding the coverage and sequence:The PPT slides for this session were shared only yesterday, which created a gap between the topics I had initially prepared and the updated slide content. As a result, I focused on tools like Gamma, Code2Tutorial, and Otter AI to demonstrate real-world applications of Generative AI, which unfortunately deviated from the exact sequence of the slides.Due to this misalignment, examples related to Swiggy, Amazon, and BookMyShow were not covered in detail. I acknowledge this as a gap and will ensure these business use cases are prioritized in the upcoming sessions",Tech QA report issue
