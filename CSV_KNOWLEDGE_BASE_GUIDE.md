📈 Accuracy: 10/10 (100.0%)
```

## 🚀 How to Use Your CSV Knowledge Base

### **Method 1: Use the Improved Knowledge Base (Recommended)**
```bash
# Load the optimized knowledge base with 100% accuracy
python3 improve_csv_knowledge_base.py
```

### **Method 2: Load Raw CSV Data**
```bash
# Load directly from your CSV file (lower accuracy)
python3 load_csv_knowledge_base.py
```

### **Method 3: Add Custom Entries**
Edit `improve_csv_knowledge_base.py` and add your own categories:

```python
{
    "category": "Your New Category",
    "team": "Your Team Name",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "specific phrase"],
    "description": "Description of this category",
    "weight": 1.0  # Higher weight = higher priority
}
```

## 📊 Team Distribution

Your CSV data maps to **4 teams**:

- **Product/Tech** (3 categories): Platform Issues, Tech QA Report Issue, Student Portal
- **Facilities** (2 categories): Facilities, Other On Ground Issues  
- **Curriculum/Content** (2 categories): Session Timing Issues, Scheduling Issue
- **Instructor** (1 category): Session Handling Issues

## 🔍 Keyword Analysis

### **Most Effective Keywords by Category:**

**Platform Issues:**
- `instructor portal`, `recording`, `upload`, `portal not working`, `recording failed`

**Facilities:**
- `mic`, `battery`, `projector`, `wifi`, `power cut`, `network`, `equipment`

**Session Timing Issues:**
- `timing`, `delay`, `late`, `page wait`, `time management`, `session time`

**Tech QA Report Issue:**
- `qa report`, `evaluation`, `feedback`, `rating`, `transcript`, `assessment`

**Student Portal:**
- `student portal`, `learning portal`, `portal access`, `login issue`, `access denied`

**Session Handling Issues:**
- `students not responding`, `students playing`, `classroom management`, `student behavior`

## 🎯 Testing Your Knowledge Base

### **Test Categorization Accuracy:**
```bash
python3 test_csv_categorization.py
```

### **Test with Custom Tickets:**
```bash
python3 test_categorization.py
```

### **Start the Dashboard:**
```bash
python3 main.py server
# Open http://localhost:8000
# Click "Fetch Tickets" to test with sample data
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### **Scoring System:**
- **Multi-word phrases**: 15 points × weight
- **Single keywords**: 10 points × weight
- **Category weights**: 1.0 - 1.2 (Platform Issues has highest priority)

### **Example Scoring:**
```
Ticket: "Instructor portal not working properly"

Matches:
- "instructor portal" (15 points)
- "portal" (10 points)
- "not working" (15 points)
- Platform Issues weight: 1.2

Final Score: (15 + 10 + 15) × 1.2 = 48 points
Result: Platform Issues → Product/Tech Team
```
